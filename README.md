# ${PROJECT TITLE}

## Description

This application was built to design a Readme file. I wanted to apply my new knowlegde of node.js to create a server application using the ES6 syntax in javascript and the terminal.
After this project I feel more confident using node.js

## Installation
To start running this project in a computer, the user needs to install node.js in their computer. In the browser search for node version no lower than 16.19.1 and download it to the computer.
Check if node.js was installed going to gitbash and typing "node", the terminal will show the version of node installed.
```bash
node
Welcome to Node.js v16.19.1.
```

Now open VS Code and in the terminal type npm inquirer@8.2.4 to install the inquirer package that assists with the prompt questions that designs the readme file. 
Now the computer is ready to read the code.

## Usage

The video shows an user going to the terminal and typing node.js and then a series of questions pop up. When the user answers the questions, a readme file is generated and those responses are added to the file.
