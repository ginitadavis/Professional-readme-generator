# Description

This application was built to design a Readme file. I wanted to apply my new knowledge of node.js to create a server application using the ES6 syntax in javascript. After this project I feel a little more comfortable using node.js

# Installation
To start running this project in a computer, the user needs to install node.js in their computer. In the browser search for a node version no lower than 16.19.1 and download it. Check if node.js was installed going to gitbash and typing "node", the terminal will show the version of node installed. Now open Visual Studio and in the terminal type nmp inquirer@8.2.4 to install the inquirer package that assists with the prompt questions that designs the readme file.



# Usage

This video shows an user going to the terminal and typing node index.js and then a series of questions appear in the terminal. A readme file is generated with the answers.
