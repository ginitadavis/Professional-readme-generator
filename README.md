## Installation
After this project I feel more confident using node.jsTo start running this project in a computer, the user needs to install node.js in their computer. In the browser search for a node version no lower than 16.19.1 and download it to the computer.

## Usage

Check if node.js was installed going to gitbash and typing "node", the terminal will show the version of node installed.The video shows an user going to the terminal and typing node.js and then a series of questions pop up. When the user answers the questions, a readme file is generated and those responses are added to the file.
